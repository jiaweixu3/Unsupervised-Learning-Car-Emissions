### üîç Analytical Workflow

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Feature Engineering:** Removed irrelevant variables (identifiers, imperial metrics) and merged correlated ones (`fuel_cost_12000_miles` + `fuel_cost_6000_miles` ‚Üí `fuel_cost`).  
- **Imputation:** Addressed missing values with **multiple imputation (`mice`)**.  
- **Outlier Detection:** Applied the **3-sigma rule**, retaining only meaningful extreme values.  
- **Standardization:** Transformed categorical variables into factors and scaled numerical features.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
- Built correlation heatmaps to detect **multicollinearity** among fuel efficiency metrics.  
- Analyzed `CO` and `NOx` emissions by *Euro Standard*, illustrating how regulation drives environmental performance.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**  
  - Three components explained **76.4%** of variance.  
  - **PC1:** *Environmental Friendliness* ¬∑ **PC2:** *Modernity* ¬∑ **PC3:** *Engine Efficiency*  
- **FA (Factor Analysis):**  
  - Extracted 3 latent factors explaining **69%** of variance.  
  - Factors identified as:  
    1. *Environmental Impact* (CO‚ÇÇ, engine capacity, fuel cost)  
    2. *Fuel Price Evolution* (year, fuel type)  
    3. *Chemical Emissions* (NOx, CO)

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering & Segmentation
- **K-Means & PAM:**  
  - Optimal **k = 4** via WSS, Silhouette, and Gap Statistic.  
  - Segmented vehicles into 4 tiers ‚Äî *Affordable*, *Mid-Range*, *Luxury*, *Specialized*.  
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (Mclust):**  
  - Best configuration: `VEV` (ellipsoidal, equal shape) with **9 components**.  
  - Strong **BIC (-18669.28)** and **ICL (-19398.36)** confirm model validity.  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:**  
  - Used **Ward‚Äôs linkage** and **Euclidean distance** on first 5 PCA components (91.4% variance).  
  - Combined **Agglomerative (`hclust`)** and **Divisive (`diana`)** to ensure cluster consistency.
